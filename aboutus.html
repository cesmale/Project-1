											Claire grew up cycling in Montreal with her parents who once worked for Butterfield and Robinson, a bike touring company. The foundation was laid for a passion that she would fully discover when she began working at Cycle Technique, a bike shop in Montreal. During her first year at Dawson College, she applied to UBC and was accepted into the faculty of Arts. Before leaving, she revisited the idea of a great Canadian road trip and played with the idea of cycling instead of driving across. After leaving for Vancouver, the trip seemed like a possibility; she mentioned the idea to Oliver who immediately asked if he could join! Claire is an advocate for cycling as a primary mode of transit. She believes if she can cycle across, then she can cycle anywhere.

											Tom Nichini is a 20 year old student and musician born and raised in Vancouver, BC. He plays two instruments - the piano and the bagpipes - while studying at the University of British Columbia. In April 2014, he completed his second year of Arts and hopes to continue studies in sustainability. During his free time, Tom plays music, skis (and ski patrols), reads, and (obviously) cycles. Despite various trips around the globe, there is still much of Canada he has to discover. This tour is an opportunity for Tom to explore his country and its people on his favourite mode of transit (his bike) while possibly getting a six pack!

											Born and raised in Montreal, Oliver has been a bike aficionado since 2007. He got his first job as a bike mechanic in 2011 and has worked at various bike shops in Montreal including Giant and Cycle Technique. When Oliver first heard about the trip, he was hesitant because of his heart condition; however, with approval from his doctor he quickly joined. Oliver cannot believe this trip is finally happening and is excited to fly out to Vancouver.
