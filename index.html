					<h2>About The Trip</h2>
							<p>
								The story begins with Claire (20) and Oli (21), two friends from Montreal, who set an ambitious goal to bike tour a mari usque ad mare (from sea to sea) across Canada. Every year they spoke of their epic summer adventure but were waiting for an opportune moment. Eventually, Claire left to attend the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and Oli stayed to complete his program at CEGEP.
								At University, Claire quickly met a local, Tom (20), and within a week, they were already exploring the Pacific Northwest together. Over the course of the year, Coco (19 and also a local) added to the adventures, going on hikes, skis, sails, cycles, and more. A crew formed and Claire realized there were two more who might contribute to the Cross Canada Tour.
 								Over the next year, the trip became a reality; talking, convincing, brainstorming, planning, and a trip by Oli out to Vancouver culminated until we all booked a summer off to cycle approximate 7,000 km from coast to coast.
 								The story "ends" with us arriving in St-John's NL after 57 days of riding and a total of 75 days on the road, still friends and having accomplished an amazing feat together! Thanks to everyone who helped us along the way.
 								This website will serve as a blog, journal, gallery, and contact for our group. Keep on riding!
