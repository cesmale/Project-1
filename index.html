								The story begins with Claire (20) and Oli (21), two friends from Montreal, who set an ambitious goal to bike tour a mari usque ad mare (from sea to sea) across Canada. Every year they spoke of their epic summer adventure but were waiting for an opportune moment. Eventually, Claire left to attend the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and Oli stayed to complete his program at CEGEP.
								At University, Claire quickly met a local, Tom (20), and within a week, they were already exploring the Pacific Northwest together. Over the course of the year, Coco (19 and also a local) added to the adventures, going on hikes, skis, sails, cycles, and more. A crew formed and Claire realized there were two more who might contribute to the Cross Canada Tour.
 								Over the next year, the trip became a reality; talking, convincing, brainstorming, planning, and a trip by Oli out to Vancouver culminated until we all booked a summer off to cycle approximate 7,000 km from coast to coast.
 								The story "ends" with us arriving in St-John's NL after 57 days of riding and a total of 75 days on the road, still friends and having accomplished an amazing feat together! Thanks to everyone who helped us along the way.
 								This website will serve as a blog, journal, gallery, and contact for our group. Keep on riding!

											Claire grew up cycling in Montreal with her parents who once worked for Butterfield and Robinson, a bike touring company. The foundation was laid for a passion that she would fully discover when she began working at Cycle Technique, a bike shop in Montreal. During her first year at Dawson College, she applied to UBC and was accepted into the faculty of Arts. Before leaving, she revisited the idea of a great Canadian road trip and played with the idea of cycling instead of driving across. After leaving for Vancouver, the trip seemed like a possibility; she mentioned the idea to Oliver who immediately asked if he could join! Claire is an advocate for cycling as a primary mode of transit. She believes if she can cycle across, then she can cycle anywhere.

											Tom Nichini is a 20 year old student and musician born and raised in Vancouver, BC. He plays two instruments - the piano and the bagpipes - while studying at the University of British Columbia. In April 2014, he completed his second year of Arts and hopes to continue studies in sustainability. During his free time, Tom plays music, skis (and ski patrols), reads, and (obviously) cycles. Despite various trips around the globe, there is still much of Canada he has to discover. This tour is an opportunity for Tom to explore his country and its people on his favourite mode of transit (his bike) while possibly getting a six pack!

											Born and raised in Montreal, Oliver has been a bike aficionado since 2007. He got his first job as a bike mechanic in 2011 and has worked at various bike shops in Montreal including Giant and Cycle Technique. When Oliver first heard about the trip, he was hesitant because of his heart condition; however, with approval from his doctor he quickly joined. Oliver cannot believe this trip is finally happening and is excited to fly out to Vancouver.
